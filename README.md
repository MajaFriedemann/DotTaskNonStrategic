# About this project

Boldt and Yeung's (2015) dot discrimination task is a perceptual decision-making task in which participants are asked to judge which of two boxes contains the greater number of dots and to report their confidence in each judgment on a rating scale. Staircasing is used to maintain a constant level of performance.
This is a "social" version where the participant sees a partner's response and confidence rating after reporting their own. This is the non-strategic version where participants do not get any objective feedback and simply report their confidence levels in parallel with a virtual partner.
